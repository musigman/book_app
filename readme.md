# book_app
Lots of information about any city of your choosing!  The website displays information for a user defined city through aggregation of data via 6 APIs.


# Excellent Reading Adventure (book_app)

**Author**: Paul Leonard and Keith Musig
**Version**: 2.0.0

## Overview
Search the web for your current and future favorite books!  Save them to a list to help you remember.


## Architecture
This project develops a backend information gathering, management, and aggregation system to provide search results for books to the user.  A google API is used to find relevant books.  The user can save favorite books to a postgres SQL database.  The backend is written in JavaScript using Node.js.  Libraries used in this server include express, dotenv, superagent, pg, method_override, and ejs.

A books.sql file was created and used to create the books table in the postgres database called books_app.
